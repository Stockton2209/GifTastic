### App Features
* This is a small app that produces gifs of super villains.
* JavaScript and jQuery do most of the heavy lifting for the buttons to produce gifs.
* The gifs, retrieved from the Giphy API by AJAX, enter the page static, but animate when clicked on.
* There is a search bar to create new buttons for even more gifs!
* Each gif comes with it's very own rating for your viewing convenience.
